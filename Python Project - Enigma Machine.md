# Python Project - Enigma Machine

**Objective**: In this project, we’ll be creating an “enigma machine” that will allow us to encode and decode messages using a simple rotational cipher. Your program will be able to encrypt a message from text or file, and decrypt a file into text with the following behavior.

Have a "Main Menu" which offers the following options:
- [ ] Have the user write a message, and ask for a key. Encode the message using a *Vigenère cipher*, then display the encoded message to the screen and give the user the option to write to a new file.
- [ ] Have the user enter a filename containing a string message, and ask for a key. Encode the contents of the file using a *Vigenère cipher*, then display the encoded message, and ask the user if they'd like to **overwrite** the existing file with the new message, or write to a new file.
- [ ] Have the user enter a filename containing an encoded string message, and ask for a key. Decode the contents of the file using a *Vigenère cipher*, and ask the user if they'd like to **overwrite** the existing file with a new message, or write to a new file.
- [ ] Your program should be able to account for various input validation errors, and handle the input of numbers/symbols gracefully. 
- [ ] Your program should account for file system errors, such as *FileNotFound* exceptions.

## Submission Guidelines
Please submit your file by pushing all changes to your assigned git repository. Your submission should include the following:
- Your main Python file(s). For this project your submission should be labeled *Lastname_apples.py*
- **At least three** screenshots of terminal output done from your own testing. Include them in the same directory as your Python file.
## Grading Schema
### Summative Assessments & Projects
*In an effort to provide students with more consistent grades & feedback, I am following a grading schema called **specification grading**. The rules for the version I will  implement are simple:*

- Each project has a certain number of “features” that are required to be considered a complete project. Students are graded by each outlined feature according to the table below and then provided feedback on how they can improve. Point allocation will also be accompanied by comprehensive feedback that provides additional guidance to the student.
- If a student wishes to improve on their project they are allotted up to one and a half weeks from receiving the feedback to provide a re-submission and notify their teacher. Corrections made will receive partial credit. 
- Late or incomplete programs will receive a point reduction that emphasizes the importance of turning in assignments on time without making the potential loss “not worth the effort” of doing the assignment. 
- Late assignments will receive a reduction of 5% in total possible points for each school day it is late. If the assignment is not turned in by the end of the week the assignment is due AND the student has not contacted the instructor, it will be considered as missing (MIS) in the gradebook.
- If the student contacts the instructor and informs them that their assignment will be late, that instructor can extend the assignment’s due date for that student. The above rule applies to the new projected due date.
- Assignments where it is evident that the student has not provided sufficient effort (i.e. the example/template code is the only thing that has been submitted) will be considered as missing (MIS) in the gradebook.
- Due to the nature of programming assignments, any project that cannot be executed by the instructor will be considered as missing (MIS) in the gradebook. However, if a student re-submits that project in an executable state within the due date, they will not incur any penalties.

| 5     | Response gives evidence of a complete understanding of the problem; is fully developed; is clearly communicated.                                 |
| 4     | Response gives the evidence of a clear understanding of the problem but contains minor errors or is not fully communicated.                      |
| 3     | Response gives evidence of a reasonable approach but indicates gaps in conceptual understanding. Explanations are incomplete, vague, or muddled. |
| 2     | Response gives some evidence of problem understanding but contains major programming or reasoning errors.                                        |
| 1     | No response or response is completely incorrect or irrelevant.                                                                                   |
